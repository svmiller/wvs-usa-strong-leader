> **tl;dr**: the U.S. is conspicuous among its democratic peers in its preferences for strong leaders with discretionary authority. These preferences are on the rise. Educational attainment is an important attribute. Better educated Americans are less likely to prefer that kind of head of state. White Americans are actually less likely to prefer this type of executive authority but the effect of lower levels of education on white respondents is stronger than the effect on other racial/ethnic categories. Republicans with no more than a high school education are more likely to prefer that strong leader in the most recent World Values Survey wave. These attitudes in support of a strong leader have important implications for other attitudes about democracy among Americans.
